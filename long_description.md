This application enables the transcription of a particular collection of the Scottish Political Archive: the leaflets from the' YES' and 'NO' campaigns of the 2014 Scottish Referendum.

The Scottish Political Archive (SPA) was launched in October 2010 and is housed at the University of Stirling.
The SPA collects political material and archives from Scottish politicians and political organisations
to chronicle the political history of Scotland in the twentieth and twenty first centuries.

We would like your help with transcribing the content of the leaflets and annotating the presence of any graphic elements that appear on the leaflets.
