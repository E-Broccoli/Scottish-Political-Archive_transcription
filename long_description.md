This application enables the transcription of the leaflets from the yes and no groups for the 2014 Scottish Referendum, a collection of the Scottish Political Archive.

The Scottish Political Archive (SPA) was launched in October 2010 and is housed at the University of Stirling.
The SPA aims to collect political material and archives from Scottish politicians and political organisations
to chronicle the political history of Scotland in the twentieth and twenty first centuries.

Images will be drawn from the Scottish Political Archive Flickr feed and redisplayed in the browser window. We would like help in transcribing the content of the leaflet also annotating the presence of graphic elements describing them.


This application should be a very straightforward and will contribute to an overall goal of transcribing the full set of Scottish Political Archive leaflets.
